A turkey, huh? OK, try to imagine yourself in the Cretaceous Period. 
You get your first look at this "six foot turkey" as you enter a clearing. He moves like a bird, 
lightly, bobbing his head. And you keep still because you think that maybe his visual acuity is 
based on movement like T-Rex - he'll lose you if you don't move. But no, not Velociraptor. You
stare at him, and he just stares right back. And that's when the attack comes. Not from the front, 
but from the side,
