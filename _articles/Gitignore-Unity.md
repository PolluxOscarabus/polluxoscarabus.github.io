## General rules for gitignore file

* blank lines or starting with **#** are ignored
  * Use blackslash **\** to indicate the hash character **#** in a pattern
* negate a pattern by using **!**
* Start line with **/** to concern only the current directory, and avoid recursivity
* Include directory content recursively by ending line with **/**
* Standard Glob patterns (simplified regular expression) are recognized
  * Use asterisk \* to match zero or more characters 
  * Use bracket [abc] to match any of the characters given in the set  
  * Use character ? to match a single characters 
  * Use bracket [0-9] to match any characters in the indicated range 
  * Use double asterix \*\* to match all elements
    * when before a slash, seaches matches in all directories
      > **/a matches all a
      > **/a/b matches all b inside a directory a
    * when after a slash, searches all matches inside the current directory
      > a/** matches all files inside a
    * when between two slashes, searches all matches insides all directories in the current directory
      > a/**/b matches a/b, a/one/b, a/two/b, a/one/two/b


## Elements to ignore in a Unity project

* When using Collaborate, the file to edit is the **.collabignore** file in the Project folder.
* Certain Project files and directories can't be excluded
  * The asset folder, however files and directories within can.
  * The Project Setting folder
  * Any .asset file inside the Project Settings folder
